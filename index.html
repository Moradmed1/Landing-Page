					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>The Weather Web Application was born out of a need for fast and accurate 
					weather reports during travel. As someone who regularly needs to plan trips
					or activities, I often found existing solutions </p>
					<p>cumbersome or slow. This project allowed me to combine my love for technology
					with a practical solution to a daily problem. The idea was to make weather updates
					easy to access while providing a beautiful, responsive design</p>
